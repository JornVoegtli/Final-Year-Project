# Final-Year-Project

## FYP

**The FYP folder contains all the Matlab code, data and graphs used/made during the project.**
**The code has been partially commented but is quite simple to follow**

## HMC5883L, I2Cdev, MPU6050

**These three libraries were provided by Jeff Rowberg's I2Cdevlib and adapted by myself. The credit to reverse engineering the information lies with him. More information can be found on his website here: [I2cdevlib.com](https://www.i2cdevlib.com/)**

All the has been tested with an Arduino Uno clone, MPU-6050 Gy-521 breakout board and HMC5883L Ardufruit Compass.
